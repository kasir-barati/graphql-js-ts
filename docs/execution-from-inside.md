# Execution from inside

- Each field defined in a [type system](./glossary.md#typeSystemDefinitionInGraphql) behaves like a function.
- Each field returns the next type.
- Each field on each type is backed by a resolver function.

  - E.g. when [here](https://github.com/kasir-barati/graphql-js-ts/blob/63439cd4029023736636e039a1ddea2686b974b3/apps/scalar-types/src/main.ts#L30) we are returning a `RandomDie` and inside that type we have `roll` and `rollOnce` which are also considered resolvers.

    Though we never really passed them explicitly as resolver to our `rootApi` variable.

- The execution stops when you return a scalar/enum type -- [like `Todo` object type](https://github.com/kasir-barati/graphql-js-ts/blob/63439cd4029023736636e039a1ddea2686b974b3/apps/todo-backend/src/schema.ts#L10-L20).

## Resolvers

<a href="#fourArgumentsOfAnyResolverFunction" id="fourArgumentsOfAnyResolverFunction">#</a> A resolver function receives four arguments:

```ts
async function getTodo(
  /**
   * @description
   * The previous object.
   *
   * - AKA root, or parent.
   * - A GraphQL server needs to call the resolvers of a queryâ€™s fields. GraphQL does a breadth-first (level-by-level) resolver call. The root argument in each resolver call is simply the result of the previous call.
   * - Mostly won't be used.
   */
  obj,
  /**
   * @description
   * Arguments/parameters passed to a field in a GraphQL operation.
   * @example `getTodo(id: ID!)`
   */
  args: { id: string },
  /**
   * @description
   * An object that every resolver can write to and read from it so that resolvers can communicate.
   *
   * Holds important contextual information, things like:
   * - Access to a database.
   * - The currently logged in user.
   */
  context: { db: PrismaClient },
  /**
   * @description
   * The Abstract Syntax Tree representation of a query or mutation.
   *
   * Holds field-specific* info and the schema details.
   *
   * *Things relevant to the current operation.
   */
  info,
) {
  const todo = await context.db.todo.find({
    where: { id: args.id },
  });
  const graphqlTodoObject = new GraphqlTodo(todo);

  return graphqlTodoObject;
}
class GraphqlTodo {
  public id: string;
  public title: string;
  public content: string;
  public createdAt: Date;
  public updatedAt: Date;
  public CreatedBy: { id: string; username: string };
  public createdById: string;
  public AssignedTo: { id: string; username: string };
  public assignedToId: string;

  constructor(todo: PrismaTodo) {
    this.id = todo.id;
    this.title = todo.title;
    this.content = todo.content;
    this.createdAt = todo.createdAt;
    this.updatedAt = todo.updatedAt;
    this.CreatedBy = todo.CreatedBy;
    this.createdById = todo.createdById;
    this.AssignedTo = todo.AssignedTo;
    this.assignedToId = todo.assignedToId;
  }
}
```

<a href="trivialResolvers">#</a> Note that we do not need to define trivial resolvers like `getTodoName` which does something like this:

```ts
function getTodoName(obj: GraphqlTodo, args, context, info) {
  return obj.name;
}
```

Most of the times when we have not defined a resolver the lib we're using to build our GraphQL service assume that there is a property/method named exactly the same as the field. Thus it automatically calls that one.

### What is AST

- Stands for Abstract Syntax Tree.
- A data structure.
- A very broad term used in computer science ([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree)).
- Represents the structure of a program, code snippet, or a GraphQL query.
- A tree representation of the abstract syntactic structure of text (often source code, but here a GraphQL query) written in a [formal language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_language).
  - In GraphQL a query comes in as a string, this string must be split into meaningful sub-strings\* and parsed into a representation that the machine understands.
