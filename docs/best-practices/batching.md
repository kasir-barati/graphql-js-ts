# Batching technique:

- Multiple requests for data from a backend are collected over a short period of time and then dispatched in a single request to an underlying database or microservice by using a tool like [DataLoader](https://github.com/graphql/dataloader).
- **Note**: Most database engines have built-in baching mechanisms.

## Dataloader

- [Lee Byron](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lee-byron/) and his colleague had a meeting with engineers at Pinterest.
- They saw some common themes and patterns that they had solved at Facebook and were current issues at Pinterest.
- So they started to develop this lib.
- Responsible for:
  - **Batching**: Fetching .
  - **Caching**: Instead of loading same data from DB for different part of a GraphQL query we'll do it once, and use the cached value going forward.

### Create a Dataloader

Provide a function that is your batch function:

- This batch function is responsible for going to the database and doing whatever needs to happen.
- Take an array of IDs and return an array of promises which in turn resolve the requested values for each ID.

> [!NOTE]
>
> When calling the Dataloader to load data (e.g. `user.loader(1)`), **Dataloader will batch this query with other calls** that **happened in the same tick of event loop**.

You can also pass an options to it:

- Turn on an off batching and or caching.
- `cacheKeyFn` in case your key ain't scalar type.
- `cacheMap`:
  - By default it's an ES6 `Map` object.
  - Will be thrown away when our Dataloader instance get garbage collected.
  - The default behavior is ok when you're creating a new Dataloader instance on every request.

### Caching in Dataloader

- It does return same `Promise` object when you call it with the same key more than once.

### Event Loop + Dataloader + `Promise`

- Promises work in JS because of microtasks.
- At the end of a run loop, there is a microtask queue (learn more [here](https://github.com/kasir-barati/awesome-js-ts/tree/main/apps/hodgepodge-container/src/event-loop#microtask)) and by the time we reach the end of a frame of execution JS will goes through microtasks queue and will execute all of them.

> [!CAUTION]
>
> NodeJS has two Microtasks queues. So in order to run something after promises you need to make sure that you're calling `process.nextTick` after all promises are resolved.
